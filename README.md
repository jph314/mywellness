---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An analysis into data taken from the mywellness system at Contours Gym, The Stour Centre, Ashford, UK. This analysis concerns the amount of exercise new users complete in their first month, the number of training days in the first month, and the likelihood of them continuing.

It uses various Python libraries to arrange the data, perform simple calculations, create predictive models and graph the data. 

The full technical analysis can be found in First Month MOVEs and Days.html (First Month MOVEs and Days.ipynb), while a largely non-technical report can be read in mywellness analysis.
